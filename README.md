The Advanced Programming course goes over **C programming**, by focusing on **abstract data types** including the main components, **structures**, **linked lists**, **modules**, **memory management, **file handling**, and the **compilation process**... In addition, **C++ programming** principles and mechanisms like **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **generic programming**, and **templates** were taught. The course also teaches script languages as another approach to programming.

## Heroes of-Might and Magic - C++
A project that simulates the game "Heroes of Might and Magic" using CLI. The project is written in **C++** and it focuses on **Object-Oriented** principles, **generic programming**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **exception handling**.
